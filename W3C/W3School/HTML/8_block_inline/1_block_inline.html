        <h1>(1) HTML Block and Inline Elements</h1>
        The < div> element is often used as a container for other HTML elements. The < div> element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.
        When used together with CSS, the < div> element can be used to style blocks of content:
        <h3>A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).</h3>
        <div style="border: 1px solid black">Hello World</div>
        <p>The DIV element is a block element, and will always start on a new line and take up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).</p>
        <img src="block_elem.png" alt="">
   
        <h1>(2) Inline Elements</h1>
        <h3>An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.</h3>
        <img src="inlineElem.png" alt="" style="border: solid 1px powderblue;">
        <br> <br>
        <img src="inline.png" alt="">
